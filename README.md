Overview

This repository contains the implementations of two distinct projects assigned in the Artificial Intelligence course taught at the University of Ioannina. The projects focus on the practical application of algorithms to solve problems related to cube placement and game strategy.

Project 1: Cube Placement Algorithm

In the first project, we tackle the problem of placing N=3K numbered cubes into a desired formation using either Uniform Cost Search (UCS) or A Search Algorithm, with K provided by the user. The goal is to arrange these cubes in three rows on a table, with specific positioning and movement cost considerations.

Features

•	Implementation of UCS to find the least cost path from an initial valid formation to the target formation.

•	Implementation of A* Search using an acceptable heuristic function to optimize the search process.

•	Comparison between UCS and A* Search in terms of path cost and the number of expansions.

Project 2: Game Construction

The second project involves constructing a game between two players (USER vs PC) using the Minimax algorithm. This game simulates a card game with specific rules for card distribution and movement across different groups.

Features

•	Definition of game state and valuation of final states using the Minimax algorithm.

•	Dynamic state changes based on user input and PC's strategy to simulate the gameplay.

•	Utility functions to check valid game states, free cubes, and movement cost.

Prerequisites

•	Java Development Kit (JDK) for Java implementation or GCC for C implementation.

•	No external libraries are required for the execution of these projects.

Running the Projects

2.	Navigate to the project directory.
3.	Compile the source code.
